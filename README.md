# Sophie - The Civic Data Agent

**Sophie** is an autonomous AI agent that makes complex, scattered civic and community data accessible to everyone through natural language.

This project aims to build a solution for the **AI Accelerate Hackathon**, creatively combining the Fivetran and Elastic challenges. It uses a custom Fivetran connector to ingest data from unique civic sources (like city council PDFs and local news feeds) into Google Cloud, and leverages Elastic's AI-powered search to allow users to ask complex questions about their community.

## Core Features

- **Custom Data Ingestion:** A Fivetran connector built to pull data from disparate, often unstructured, public sources.
- **Conversational Search:** An intuitive, chat-based interface where users can ask questions in plain English.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Utilizes Google Cloud's Gen AI with Elastic's hybrid search (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers with links to source documents.

This repository is the home for the project, containing all source code, documentation, and instructions.
